              <p class="edu-journey">Stevens is in Hoboken, right across from Manhattan in the heart of the NYC area. Coming here for my Master's as an international student brought very unexpected challenges: it was the first time I was studying so far from home, and I had to learn to do everything on my own. That experience really shaped me. I also met a lot of people from different backgrounds some came to Stevens right out of college, some had years of experience, and some were working professionals balancing jobs and school. Each of them offered a different perspective.</p>
              <p class="edu-journey">During my Master's I've stayed focused on balancing coursework, projects, and life. What I'm learning has significantly contributed to my understanding of AI and systems in the real world. I've had the privilege of learning from professors who work in industry and research; each of them has left a lasting impression on me. Doing it all as an international student taught me to rely on myself and figure things out on my own and that's something I carry with me every day.</p>

              <p class="edu-journey">PPSU, near Surat, is where it all started for me. The courses below from Programming for Problem Solving and Data Structures to Full Stack Development, Machine Learning, and AI gave me the foundation I still lean on. I loved teaching Data Structures, Computer Applications, and DBMS as an intern and mentoring 40+ students; it taught me how to explain ideas clearly and stay focused on what actually works. The projects I built here (E-commerce, Travel Booking, forms, blogs—many of them on <a href="https://github.com/Archipatel12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>) led me to my internship at Casepoint and eventually to Stevens.</p>

            <p class="exp-reflection">This internship was my first time leading a technical team. I learned how to balance writing code with coordinating others sprint planning, code reviews, and keeping delivery on track. Building CareerLink from idea to deployment showed me how .NET, SQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ fit together in a real product, and implementing AI-based resume scoring connected what I'd learned in school to a production system. The experience reinforced how much I enjoy full-stack and AI work, and it gave me confidence in both technical execution and teamwork.</p>

            <p class="exp-overview">P P Savani University (PPSU) is an NAAC A+ institution with a School of Engineering near Surat. I joined as a Teaching Intern and was responsible for delivering undergraduate courses and supporting students in the lab. It was my first formal teaching experience, and it taught me how to explain complex ideas clearly and support others as they learn.</p>
            <p class="exp-overview">My key responsibilities included designing and delivering lectures and labs for Data Structures, Computer Applications, and DBMS, and mentoring 40+ students in lab sessions to build their coding confidence and problem-solving skills.</p>

            <p class="exp-reflection">Teaching forced me to understand the material at a deeper level if I couldn't explain it simply, I hadn't really got it yet. Mentoring 40+ students in the lab showed me how different everyone's learning path is, and it improved my patience and my ability to break down problems. The experience shaped how I communicate technical ideas and gave me confidence that I can both build software and help others learn. It's something I carry with me in every team and project since.</p>
